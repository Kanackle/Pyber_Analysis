# Pyber_Analysis
###
## Summary of the Project
Writing Python scripts using Pandas library and MatPlotLib to showcase the relationship between type of city and the number of riders, drivers, and fares
###
## Results and Analysis
The results of the ride-sharing date are as follows:
### Total rides per city type
> Urban: 1625\
> Suburban: 625<br />
> Rural: 125 

### Total drivers per city type
> Urban: 2405 (Note that there are more drivers than rides)\
> Suburban: 490\
> Rural: 78

### Total fares per city type
> Urban: 39854.38<br />
> Suburban: 19356.33<br />
> Rural: 4327.93

### Average fare per city type
> Average urban fare per ride is 24.53\
> Average suburban fare per ride is 30.97\
> Average rural fare per ride is 34.62

### Average fare per driver
> Average urban fare per driver is 16.57\
> Average suburban fare per driver is 39.5\
> Average rural fare per driver is 55.49

### Some Further Recommendations
1) The most obvious recommendation is that there is an oversaturation of drivers for the urban areas. A large majority of drivers are getting any customers to drive. To better desaturate this, these drivers can either be moved to the suburbs or the rural areas, or they can be cut altogether. <br />
2) There is a large disparity between the average fare per driver between the rural and urban areas. The best way to solve this would be to add more drivers to the rural areas (although, you should be careful not to oversaturate the rural areas) or to lessen the number of drivers in the urban areas. <br />
3) More support needs to be added in the rural areas. Whether that be adding more ride options, some sort of sale, an advertisement, or any other form of support, it is clear that the rural area is lagging far behind the urban and suburban areas. How what is not clear is the reason why. More data is needed before going to a conclusion. However, from just the given data, an easy assumption to make is that there is not enough support for ridesharing in the rural areas.
